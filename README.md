# pseudo_network
This code is for creating pseudo water network!
We created both .py file and .ipynb file. You will utilize them depents on your tasks.
We prepared a simple task to learn how to use our code. If you want to know how to use it, please follow below.

# task example
## dataset preparation
In this task, we use nepal raod information as pseudo network.
download npl_rdsl_trans_25K_50K_sdn_wgs84.zip from https://data.humdata.org/dataset/nepal-road-network unser ./data/road dir.

## excute data_collection.py or data_collection.ipynb
In this file, you will get random tap points, random source points, target district raod.

### random tap points
We create tap water point information as goal points in this task.

### random source points
We change some ramdom tap points to source points. We will get the network info between tap points and source points.

### target district
We create target district because road information is heavyto use directoly. 

## run excute.py or excute.ipynb
